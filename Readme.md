## Running the material

If you'd like to run the notebook, you can create an environment using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/). See the Pixi [installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/#__tabbed_1_2).

With Pixi installed, clone the repository, open a command line, and start Jupyter Lab from the included Pixi environment. Pixi will automatically install all required dependencies and start the IDE with the notebook.

```sh
pixi run jupyter lab
```
